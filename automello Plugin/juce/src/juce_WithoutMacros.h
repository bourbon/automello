/**
    The purpose of juce_WithoutMacros.h is to allow you to include juce.h without
    it defining macros that could interfere with other 3rd party header files.

    E.g. if code like this causes errors:
    @code
    #include <juce.h>
    #include "problematic_3rd_party_header_file.h" // causes errors because this code also uses
                                                   // macros such as "T" or "Point"...
    @endcode

    ..then you can avoid the problems by doing this:

    @code
    #include <src/juce_WithoutMacros.h> // includes everything in juce.h, but
                                        // without the macros that are likely to confict

    #include "problematic_3rd_party_header_file.h"

    #include <src/juce_DefineMacros.h>  // this is optional - including it after the
                                        // 3rd party file will re-define the juce macros
                                        // that were omitted previously. You may need to
                                        // avoid including this if your code later on uses
                                        // macros that conflict.
    @endcode
