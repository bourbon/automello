/**
    Manages a collection of properties.

    This is a slightly higher-level wrapper for PropertiesFile, which can be used
    as a singleton.

    It holds two different PropertiesFile objects internally, one for user-specific
    settings (stored in your user directory), and one for settings that are common to
    all users (stored in a folder accessible to all users).

    The class manages the creation of these files on-demand, allowing access via the
    getUserSettings() and getCommonSettings() methods. It also has a few handy
    methods like testWriteAccess() to check that the files can be saved.

    If you're using one of these as a singleton, then your app's start-up code should
    first of all call setStorageParameters() to tell it the parameters to use to create
    the properties files.
