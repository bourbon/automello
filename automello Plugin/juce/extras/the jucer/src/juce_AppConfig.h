/*
    This file contains settings that you might want to explicitly apply to
    your Juce build.

    These flags enable or disable juce features - if you're linking to juce as
    a library, then to change them, you'd need to alter your juce_Config.h file and
    recompile the juce lib. But because we're using the amalgamated file, you can
    just include this file before including your juce_amalgamated.cpp file to
    have the same effect.

    If you leave any of these commented-out, they'll take on the default value
    assigned to them in juce_Config.h, so to force them on or off, just set them
    to an explicit 0 or 1 in here.
